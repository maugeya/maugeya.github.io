My second project was a fully RESTful app. I used Express and Express Layouts, to create an app that tied in with a recent twitter hashtag #BlackGirlMagic, that was created to give praise to women of colour who have achieved amazing things across business, media and history.

Using a Model-View-Controller pattern, I made an app where a user is able to create posts of women that they have found inspirational to inspire others to seek out more information about them.

I also brought in from the Google Youtube API to give further content than what the user has issued. I created a CORS request to get search the information from the API and displayed top results for the users using iframes.
