As the first project I did at General Assembly was pretty daunting, I focused my game on a subject that I love... drag queens. I intended for the game to be light hearted and to give me a chance to use all of the skills I had learnt during the first couple of weeks on the course.

Using HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery to produce a game. To play the game, the user has to press a button to remove tiles that hid a picture behind. The user has to guess who is in the picture behind the tiles, the score is decreasing every time a tile is taken.

The user can move through the rounds before answering questions in a bonus round to gain more points.

The game used click events using jQuery and returning user input that are then assessed by functions that will determine what will happen next.
