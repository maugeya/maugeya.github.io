This was the group project of the course. We decided to create an app that acted as  a directory for developers to put up short examples of their work. We wanted a site that made it easy to be able to see projects and portfolio of other developers and then contact them about their work.

We implemented a number of features such as users being able to 'like' projects, and being able to filter through projects that had been uploaded by projects.!
Using Trello to organise our team, we gave each other tasks and had our own group stand-up every morning to organise the work ahead. We also integrated the use of Google Maps, NewsApi and EventBrite APIs, to help create an online hub for developers to be able to be a 'One Stop' place for information.

Also as a part of the project, we worked on creating and implementing tests to our backend using Mocha and Chai. Creating user stories, really helped in the planning of the work ahead and organise where we needed to direct most of our attention to get the task done in the time provided.

I spent the beginning of the project setting up our back end API. I created the controllers, models and secure routes and tested on Insomnia to make sure it was all working correctly. I worked on the progress bar for the user’s profiles, using documentation from UI Bootstrap and creating a virtual in the user model to dynamically change the bar depending on how much of the profile was full. I was also able to work with Angular UI Select2 to give the ability to tag technologies in an easy way on projects and profiles.
